For the experimental parallelization feature, check out the [`parallelized-backend` branch](https://github.com/parimsuka/hackaTUM-check24/tree/parallelized-backend).

## To the Check24 team

Our implementation requires some heavy precalculation. Therefore it is entirely possible, that you have to wait about 5-10min after starting the container until you can access the backend API. We're sorry, if this is an inconvenience to you.
